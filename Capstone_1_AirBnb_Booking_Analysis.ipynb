Data cleaning has been and handling of duplicate values, outliers and null values to later visualize the dat. A lot of key insights has been found after analysing the relationship among the variables and came up with some solutions for Airbnb. Airbnb needs to focus on giving incentives to those hosts who are hosting more customers. They also need to focus on room types and also need to review on successful hosts to implement the same thing in other places. Manhattan being the most place of listings need to maintain or come up with more innovative ideas to make guests feel like home.\n",
